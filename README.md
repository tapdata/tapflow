## Overview

TapFlow is an API framework for TapData Live Data Platform. It provides a programmable interace to interact with TapData, such as managing replication pipelines, building wide tables/materialized views and perform general data integration tasks. 

Currently a Python SDK and interative CLI shell(Tap Shell) is available in Preview mode. 

## Use cases
You may use TapFlow for:

- Speed up the query performance of your relational database by serving the data in a high performance data store
- Create a materialized view for publishing API
- Create a wide table in data warehouse for fast analytics
- As a Kafka ETL alternative to build real time ata pipelines
- As Oracle Golden Date alternatie to sync data between different databases

## Quick Start
